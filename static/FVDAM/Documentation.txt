FVDAM Code Documentation:


PARAMETERS: NUMBER OF LEGENDRE POLYNOMIALS, MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM LOAD, NUMBER OF ITERATIONS,
            GAUSS INTEGRATION POINTS, etc..


INPUT DATA FILE:
Contains material properties, geometry, and microstructure of the repeating unit cell (RUC).
The format of the data in the input file is same as HFGMC (except there is no need for any
parameters defined after the microstructural assignment in HFGMC input data file). 
The input data file can have extensions ".fgm", ".dat", ".inp", ".fvdam".
Example: "filename.dat" 


MAIN EXECUTABLES (takes parameters)
fvdam_global_exec and fvdam_global_residual_exec


MAIN SCRIPTS (reads input data files)
fvdam_global and fvdam_global_residual


NOTE: For THERMAL only or MECHANICAL only:

TASK: Provide parameters to "fvdam_global_exec" and execute.
EXPLANATION: This will run the main script which is fvdam_global.


NOTE: For THERMOMECHANICAL, i.e., thermal followed by mechanical: 

TASK: Provide parameters to "fvdam_global_residual_exec" and execute.
EXPLANATION: This will run scripts fvdam_global for the thermal analysis followed 
by fvdam_global_residual for mechanical taking the residual streses into account.



OUTPUT FILE ("filename.out"):
The name of the output file is same as the name of the input file but with the extension
"out", i.e., "filename.out"

The output file contains the inputted material properties, geometry, microstructure,
parameters, effective stiffness matrix, effective engineering properties, the resultant
macroscopic stresses at each load increment along with number of iteration to reach 
convergence.



MATLAB OUTPUT DATA FILE ("filename.mat"):
This file contains various field variables with values at the specified load steps. Again, 
the filename is same as the name of the input data file and the extension is "mat", i.e., 
"filename.mat". In order to plot resultant variables, this file must be loaded in the 
matlab workspace or in the matlab script using the command "load filename" with or without 
the extension.
